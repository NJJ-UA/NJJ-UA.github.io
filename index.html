      <p>My name is Jingjiao Ni. Fourth years honor Computing Science student in University of Alberta. I am really interested in Computing Science, especailly in machine learning field. I have strong learning ability so I achieve 4.0 GPA in the last two years (year 2 and year 3 of university). I also would like to combine what I have learned to real-life. So I did a internship in industory and did some research with professor successively. I planned to continue to graduate study since I think there are much more knowledage I need to learn.

    <div id="cando" class="paragraph">
      <h2>What can I do</h2>
      <p>I am pretty interested in coding and machine learning (both reinforcement leaning and supervised/unsupervised learning) related projects. So I am glad to help with the experiment and analytical part of such projects. Also, I think I have good ability of learning so I may be able to handle some task that I have never done and learned before.</p>
